# Airfoil-Self-Noise-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the ENG345 Machine Learning Term Project, where various machine learning models were applied to predict the Scaled Sound Pressure Level (SPL) of airfoils based on aerodynamic and acoustic features.
